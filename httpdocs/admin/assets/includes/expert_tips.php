			<p>Did you know that you can increase your pageviews (and earnings), by giving your readers greater access to your articles? 
				Click View & Edit Articles in the menu bar on the left, and open an article that you’ve written. Scroll down, and you’ll 
				see a tool called “Related Articles.” (Please note you can only access this tool on desktop only)
			</p>
			<p>
				Use the search bars to find other articles you’ve written (or that other people have written), that are similar to the article 
				you’re editing. You can choose up to three different ones. 
			</p>

			<p>Once you find the most relevant posts and hit Save, your readers will have options at the end of each article to read other titles 
				they may be interested - driving them to other topics that you’ve written and increasing your overall pageviews.
