		Getting Featured ON
		PUCKERMOB’S FB FAN PAGE</h3>
		<div class="">
			<p>Getting featured on PuckerMob’s primary Facebook Fan page can help you increase the traffic to one or more of your articles. 
			It’s never a guarantee that your articles will be included on this page, but there are some steps you can take to increase your odds:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li> Pay attention to our Hot Topics - 		
					chances are, those are topics that 
					we’re looking to feature.
				</li>
				<li> Like our PuckerMob Voice page on 
					Facebook. Voices is where we feature 
					only articles written by our bloggers. 
					Invite your friend netork to like the 
					page as well.
				</li>
				<li> Check the Voices page regularly to see 
					if your most recent articles have been 
					included (every Pro-level article, and 
					some Basic-level articles will be added).
				</li>
				<li> If you see your article included on 
					Voices, share it - articles with higher 	
					social engagement on this page will be 
					more likely to be be included on our 
					main Facebook fan page.
				</li>
			</ol>
