			<div class="current-data" style="height: 100px; overflow: hidden;">
				<p>PuckerMob’s Ad Matching program gives you the opportunity to reach a far wider audience and significantly increase the traffic to your articles by leveraging the power of advertising on Facebook. We handle everything for you - we’ll pick which of your articles to post on our fan page, set up the ads and track the results. </p>
				<p>Even better, when you commit some of your money to advertise your articles, we’ll commit some of our own money as well - so you get all the reach for a fraction of the price!</p>
				<p>Don’t worry - you’ll never have to take any money out of your own pocket for Ad Matching purposes - instead, you tell us how much you want to spend, and we’ll deduct it from your previous earnings. The more of your earnings you commit, the more of our own money we’ll spend to advertise your articles! </p>
				<p>How to take part in Ad Matching: Simply choose one of the three options on the left. Check over the Order Form below, click the box stating that you wish to enroll in Ad Matching and hit the Submit button. That’s all there is to it! Please note, though, that Ad Matching is only open each month until the 20th. The money you commit (and that we match) will be spent the following month. Once the ads are placed and the money is spent, we’ll upload screen shot receipts to this page for you to review.</p>
