				This incentive is open to both Pro and Basic bloggers. Final outcome is based off of traffic as recorded on our dashboard, which is provided to us via Google Analytics.

				Final numbers and Top 10 winners will not be determined officially until July 2nd, and prizes will be awarded along with June’s standard payment (on or around August 22nd).

				PuckerMob.com reserves the right to promote or boost articles written by bloggers as needed, regardless of how it may effect the outcome of this incentive campaign. All articles must adhere to our standard terms and conditions - any traffic derived from articles that deviate from these terms may be cause for disqualification from this incentive campaign. In the event of technical or reporting difficulties, the Top 10 will be determined by data manually checked by PuckerMob staff, whose decisions will be final.
