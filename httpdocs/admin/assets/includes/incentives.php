			<ul>
				<li style="padding: 7px;">FOR EVERY 100,000 U.S. VISITS TO YOUR ARTICLES: $25 </li>
			</ul>

			<p>The more traffic you get, the more you make! For example, let's say you get 418,000 visits in December, you'd earn an extra $100!</p>

			<p>This incentive is open to both Pro and Basic bloggers. Final outcome is based off of traffic as recorded on our dashboard, which is provided to us via Google Analytics.</p>

			<p>Final numbers and winners will not be determined officially until January 2nd, and monetary prizes will be awarded along with Decemberâ€™s standard payment (on or around February 22nd).</p>
